## Overview
<p align="justify">Up to and including version 12.1.3 the Oracle Service Bus does not support OAUTH2/JWT inbound and outbound authentication out of the box. Starting with version 12.2.1, the OSB supports it through the use of OWSM policies but without the certification and flexibility needed to use a third-party IDP such as Azure Entra ID.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, the use of OWSM policies may not be a proper solution for those who are used to managing authentication and authorization through the simple management of users and groups of the integrated authentication provider of WebLogic. As if that wasn't enough, OAUTH2 introduces the need to adopt identities defined by very long and opaque strings (client_id), that are difficult to re-associate to a given consumer without appropriate mechanisms of credential mappings and in this OWSM is of no help.<br/><br/>
Fortunately, since the old versions of WebLogic there is the possibility to extend the product to support custom authentication schemes. The library proposed in this project is based in particular on a Custom Identity Assertion Provider that brings to the OSB an implementation of OAUTH2 authentication based on signed JWT tokens, currently only for inbound OSB security. This custom provider overcomes the rigidities of OWSM by offering more flexibility and control and optionally supports identity mapping to translate client_ids to WebLogic realm users.<br/><br/>
In addition to the JWT-based authentication scheme, the provider also offers support for the legacy Basic Auth to simplify the progressive adoption of JWT authentication by different consumers on the same Proxy Service, without the need to create different Proxies for each authentication scheme.<br/><br/>
It has currently been tested on Oracle Service Bus 12.2.1.4 and 14.1.2 with Azure Entra ID as the IDP. Starting with release 1.2 WebLogic/OSB 12.1.3 is no longer supported: installations still on 12.1.3 can keep using release 1.1.0.</p>

## Release 1.2
<p align="justify">Release 1.2 is a maintenance release whose purpose is to make the transition to the new project <a href="https://github.com/falpi/osb-jwt-providers">osb-jwt-providers</a> as smooth as possible. The new project extends this provider with an outbound provider for Business Services and replaces the MBean based configuration with declarative policies; release 1.2 lets the two packages run side by side in the same domain, so that Proxy Services can be migrated one at a time.</p>

- **WebLogic/OSB 12.1.3 is no longer supported.** The supported targets are 12.2.1.4 (JDK 8) and 14.1.2 (JDK 17); installations still on 12.1.3 can keep using release 1.1.0 with osb-commons 1.0.0.
- **Based on osb-commons 1.1.0**, the same version used by osb-jwt-providers, so that the two packages can share a single osb-commons jar.
- **Same configuration.** The provider name and the MBean attributes are unchanged: upgrading from 1.1.0 does not require any change in the realm.
- **Behaviour changes inherited from osb-commons 1.1.0**, to be checked before upgrading:
  - template variables: every <code>${...}</code> is now resolved, while release 1.1.0 (osb-commons 1.0.0) recognised only lowercase letters, dots and <code>*</code> and left the rest in the text as it was. Variables with uppercase letters, <code>_</code> or <code>-</code> (e.g. <code>${http.header.Content-Type}</code>, <code>${token.payload.tenant_region_scope}</code>) are now replaced, while names containing digits (e.g. <code>${token.header.x5t}</code>) or unknown variables now raise an error. Review the attributes that contain templates (<code>LOGGING_INFO</code>, custom headers, assertions, debugging properties, XPath expressions, resource paths);
  - errors while downloading the public keys now include the body of the HTTP response, and the HTTP client is always released after each request.

#### Upgrading from 1.1.0

1. Stop the servers and, in <code>mbeantypes</code>, replace <code>osb-jwt-provider-1.1.0*.jar</code> with the 1.2.0 jar and <code>osb-commons-1.0.0*.jar</code> with the osb-commons 1.1.0 jar of the same target (<code>osb-commons-1.1.0-&lt;date&gt;-fmw_&lt;target&gt;.jar</code>). The build copies only the provider jar, osb-commons is installed by hand.
2. Keep exactly one osb-commons jar in the folder. WebLogic loads all the jars of <code>mbeantypes</code> in a single class loader whose search order depends on the file names, not on the jar a class comes from: two copies of the same classes (for example osb-commons 1.0.0 and 1.1.0, or a separate osb-commons jar plus a package built with <code>mergeLibraries=true</code>) are resolved unpredictably and can make the realm fail at boot with errors such as <code>NoSuchFieldError</code> or <code>NoSuchMethodError</code>.
3. Restart the servers: the realm configuration does not change.

#### Coexistence with osb-jwt-providers

1. Keep in <code>mbeantypes</code> the jar of this release, the jar of osb-jwt-providers and a single osb-commons 1.1.0 jar, all without merged libraries (<code>mergeLibraries=false</code> in both builds).
2. Give the two identity asserters different active token types, for example <code>CIA.JWT+BASIC</code> to this provider and <code>CIA.JWT+BASIC#1</code> to the new inbound provider.
3. Migrate the Proxy Services one at a time by changing their token type; restoring the previous token type rolls a proxy back, without restarts or realm changes.
4. When the last Proxy Service has moved, remove this provider from the realm and its jar from <code>mbeantypes</code>.

<p align="justify">See also the section <a href="https://github.com/falpi/osb-jwt-providers#migrating-from-osb-jwt-provider">Migrating from osb-jwt-provider</a> of the osb-jwt-providers documentation.</p>

## Installation
<p align="justify">For in-depth information on Custom Providers, please refer to the product documentation (see references). In short, first you need to stop WebLogic and copy the provider package, together with the osb-commons jar of the same target (only one copy, see <a href="#release-12">Release 1.2</a>), into the folder:</p>

```<WEBLOGIC_HOME>/wlserver/server/lib/mbeantypes```

<p align="justify">Once you have restarted WebLogic, as shown in the following screenshots, you just need to create a new provider using the "Provider" tab of the Realm settings in WebLogic Console, selecting the "CustomIdentityAsserter" (CIA) item which is the identifier of this provider. We then need to reorder the providers to move ours to the top.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75512bac-005a-447e-8d12-9b999fab4c7f" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59a05b5c-1565-4bf7-99fb-8233e2da9e1f" /></p>

## Token Types
<p align="justify">Installing the provider registers in the system the presence of new types of "Tokens" that can be used to secure the Proxy Services. In WebLogic Identity Asserter terminology, Token Types are a declarative way to show which authentication schemes a given provider supports and which are active at a given time, i.e. which can be selected for authentication of a Proxy Service. The provider proposed in this project supports the JWT and BASIC schemes and allows to select them individually or in a combined way through the "JWT+BASIC" type.<br/><br/>
The "JWT+BASIC" typology is useful because on a given Proxy Service it is possible to select only one type of token at a time and the combined token allows to keep both authentication schemes active at the same time on a single Proxy Service. This allows to implement a progressive migration of consumers from the BASIC scheme to the JWT scheme in a progressive way, without having to create different Proxy Services for each scheme.<br/><br/> 
As you can see from the image below the provider offers similar types but with a different suffix (#1 and #2). This makes it possible to create multiple instances of the same provider and differentiate their configuration to support different IDPs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94a2dd0-2c46-45eb-aab2-d28b82ed1493" /></p>

## How to configure Proxy Services
<p align="justify">To enable the use of our provider on Proxy Services, you need to act from the JDeveloper IDE or from the Service Bus console on the configuration of the Proxy transport details as shown in the following screenshot.</br></br>
In the "Authentication Header" field the http header must be specified, whose presence activates the use of the custom authentication provider. It can be any valid identifier, however if you want to support the BASIC authentication scheme together with the JWT scheme, the header must necessarily be the standard "Authorization".</br></br>
In the "Authentication Token Type" field you need to select one of the token types selected as active in the Provider configuration.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29391a49-5547-48e4-a05d-3ff937863811" /></p>

## Identity mapping strategies
<p align="justify">It is possible to implement different strategies to establish the identities of the JWT token and eventually map this identity to the users of the weblogic realm. Let's see some possible scenarios below.</p>

#### 1. Direct identity
<p align="justify">The simplest scenario is to use one of the attributes of the JWT token that uniquely defines its identity (typically a "client_id"), ensuring that in the weblogic realm there is a user with the same username as the identity. This scenario does not require any identity mapping and does not necessarily require the use of special JWT claims. The problem is that in the WebLogic realm we observe the proliferation of esoteric users that are not immediately attributable to consumers. Furthermore, if a consumer already authenticates with a Basic Auth on an existing weblogic user, it cannot be reused and the profiling of users must be reproduced from scratch.</p>

#### 2. Claim identity
<p align="justify">If you can fully trust the identity provisioning process on the IDP and it is possible to request the configuration of the claims on the JWT token it is possible to implement a form of identity mapping by delegating it to the IDP. For example, you could use the standard claim "sub" (Subject) making sure that it is populated with one of the users of the weblogic realm that at this point can be created according to the format that you like, possibly reusing existing users for the Basic Auth and therefore without the need to re-profile them.</p>

In this case the `JWT_IDENTITY_ASSERTION` parameter would be valued with: `'${token.payload.sub}'`.<br/>

#### 3. Mapped identity
<p align="justify">If you prefer not to delegate the identity mapping to the IDP, you can use any of the JWT token attributes to extrapolate its identity and then map it to a realm username using a OSB "Service Account" resource. For example, if you use the Azure Entra ID as IDP, you can typically use the "appid" attribute as the token identity, which typically contains the "client_id".</p>

In this case the `JWT_IDENTITY_ASSERTION` parameter would be valued with: `'${token.payload.appid}'`.<br/>

#### 4. Combined identity
<p align="justify">It is possible to combine scenarios 2 and 3 to strengthen security, maintaining the management of the mapping on the OSB and at the same time forcing the use of a claim by verifying that it corresponds to the mapped user. In this way, you also get the benefit of forcing OAUTH2 app-registrations dedicated to use with the OSB, avoiding that identities already used in other contexts are recycled. This scenario can be implemented by leveraging the VALIDATION_ASSERTION parameter to force this verification.</p>

For example, you can configure the `VALIDATION_ASSERTION` parameter with a simple script like this:  `'${token.payload.sub}'=='${username}'`.<br/>

## How to configure Mapping Service Account
<p align="justify">The OSB resource used for translating the JWT token identity into the weblogic realm username must be a "Service Account" of type "mapping" and must be handled as highlighted in the following screenshot. Please note that it is not necessary to fill in the "Remote Password" field, which can be filled with arbitrary text.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f6af65-3cb5-4cc3-8062-a3f8a13d7b0a" /></p>

## Build instructions
<p align="justify">The sources can be compiled with any Java IDE with Ant support but you need to prepare the necessary dependencies for WebLogic and Oracle Service Bus libraries. You only need to modify "javaHomeDir" and "weblogicDir" in "Build.xml" file to suit your environment. The file supports the targets WebLogic 12.2.1 and 14.1.2 on a Windows operating system. Here is an excerpt of the section that needs to be customized.</p>

```xml
    <switch value="${targetConfig}">
      <case value="12.2.1">
        ...
        <property name="javaHomeDir" value="C:/Programmi/Java/jdk1.8"/>
        <property name="weblogicDir" value="C:/Oracle/Middleware/12.2.1"/>    
        ...
      </case>        
      <case value="14.1.2">
        ...
        <property name="javaHomeDir" value="C:/Programmi/Java/jdk17"/>
        <property name="weblogicDir" value="C:/Oracle/Middleware/14.1.2"/>    
        ...
      </case>        
      <default>
        <fail message="Unsupported target: ${targetConfig}"/>
      </default>
    </switch>    
```
Other important configuration options are as follows:
```xml
    <property name="embedSources" value="true"/>    
    <property name="mergeLibraries" value="false"/>
```
<p align="justify">The first one checks if you want to include the sources in the deploy package. The second one checks if you want to produce a "fat" (or "merged") jar archive that includes the dependencies.<br/>
    
At the moment all dependencies have been separated from the project and concentrated in the osb-commons library (see credits). You can decide whether to keep it separate instead of merged if you want to share it with any OSB extensions you want to develop (for example for extending pipelines with Java Callouts). Keeping it separate (the default) is required to share a single osb-commons jar with osb-jwt-providers during the transition.</p>

<p align="justify">The repository contains two projects already prepared for JDeveloper 12.2.1.4 and 14.1.2 installation on Windows operating system. You could install JDeveloper with respective versions of Oracle SOA Suite Quick Start for Developers (see references). Ant compilation can be triggered from JDeveloper by right-clicking on the "Build.xml" file and selecting the "all" target or from the command line by running the "Build-xxx.cmd" Windows batch. Note that cross-compilation is fully supported, meaning that you can compile the provider for a different version target than JDeveloper, provided that at least the dependency libraries are accessible and configured correctly in the Ant build targets.</p>

At the end of the compilation the jar archive is automatically copied into the ```<WEBLOGIC_HOME>/wlserver/server/lib/mbeantypes``` folder from which WebLogic loads the security providers at startup, so you can directly launch the WebLogic environment integrated into JDeveloper to test the provider's operation after build. The user running the build needs write permission on that folder: if the WebLogic installation grants it only to administrators, the deploy fails with <code>java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException</code>. In that case grant the permission once, from a prompt opened as administrator, for example <code>icacls "&lt;WEBLOGIC_HOME&gt;\wlserver\server\lib\mbeantypes" /grant "&lt;user&gt;:(OI)(CI)M"</code>.</p>

## Log Management
The log messages generated by the provider follow the following format: ```<timestamp> <module> <sequence> <level> <message>```.<br/>
Let's see below the format of each token :
Token              | Format                                                    
------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`<timestamp>`      | Timestamp with milliseconds resolution in the format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS'.
`<module>`         | Identifies log messages generated by the provider and is always equal to 'CIAx' where 'x' is a counter incremented for each running instance of the provider.
`<sequence>`       | Numeric sequence incremented at each request handled by the provider.
`<level>`          | Log message severity level (TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR).
`<message>`        | Message text<br/>

<p align="justify">The provider generates logs in its own format, with different levels of attention depending on the type of information. The logging level to filter messages is defined by the LOGGING_LEVEL parameter. Below is an almost exhaustive example of the various types of log messages generated by the provider, both during initialization (weblogic boot) and at each request.</p>

#### 1. Initialization Phase

## Threading Mode
<p align="justify">The provider code base was designed and tested to be thread-safe because Identity Asserters in WebLogic can be called in parallel and this is their normal behavior. If multiple requests arrive at the same time the server allocates a different thread for each assertion. Load tests were done with the excellent SoapUI tool reaching up to 1000 threads for parallel requests and the provider code was found to be solid and without memory leaks.</br>

However there may be situations where it is useful to force serialization of requests and this is the purpose of the "THREADING_MODE" configuration parameter. When "SERIAL" mode is selected a "synchronized" version of the assertion method is used and this causes multiple parallel requests to be queued serially, without overlapping.</br>

This could be useful for example for analyzing debug logs of a specific service in the presence of a large number of requests. In "PARALLEL" mode the log lines of each request/thread would be mixed with those of others. In "SERIAL" mode instead each assertion execution completes atomically with a consistent footprint of its logs.</p>

## Known Issues
#### 1. Invalid signature with Azure Entra ID
```com.nimbusds.jose.proc.BadJWSException: Signed JWT rejected: Invalid signature```
<p align="justify">The provider uses the excellent Nimbus library for verifying JWT tokens. Please note that using Azure Entra ID as IDP there is a known issue with Microsoft Token API v2. In this case there are some prerequisites to follow when requesting an access token. See the following articles:</p>
